# Monitoring *HealthLake*<a name="monitoring-overview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of *HealthLake* and your other AWS solutions\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch *HealthLake*, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate:
+ *Amazon CloudWatch* monitors your AWS resources and and the applications you run on AWS in real time\. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a specific threshold \. For example, you can have CloudWatch track CPU usage or other metrics of your Amazon EC2 instances and automatically launch new instances when needed\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.
+ *AWS CloudTrail* captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account\. It then delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address for those calls, and when they occurred\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.
